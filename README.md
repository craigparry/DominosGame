How to play the game: 

At the start of the game the board will be empty and the computer and the human
 player will each draw a hand of 7 dominos. 
To play a domino type in the domino with the syntax "#:#". 
A legal move is where the domino connects to an end pieces unconnected number. 
Dominos that are blanks or zeros are wild cards so they can be played on any domino.
If your hand does not have any legal plays, you will be asked to draw 
until you can play a legal move. If the graveyard runs out of dominos and the player 
cannot play a piece then the players turn ends. 
If neither player can extend the line of play of the game then the game ends 
and the last player to play the game wins. 


TODO: need to fix the end of game so that if the boneyard runs out
the game doesn't immediately end, but check first if the other player can make a move.
